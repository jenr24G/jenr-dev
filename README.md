### jenr-dev
A little portfolio website I'm building to learn OCaml and HTMX, as well as integrating Nix with both!

# Dev Setup
Install [Nix](nixos.org) and run `nix-shell` from the root of the repository!
You can build the project with `dune build src/server` and run it with `dune exec src/server/jenr_dev_server.exe`!
Simple as that!
